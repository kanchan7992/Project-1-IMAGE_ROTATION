# Image Rotation
In this project, we have to input an image and then input some angle to rotate the image and then display the modified image.

The code is written in C++ using some inbuilt Open CV libraries and functions in Visual Studio 2019 software. Open CV refers to Open Source Computer Vision which can be used in face recognition, Object recognition, automated surveillance etc.

This project is one of the good projects as a part of image processing. You could also include it in your resume.
